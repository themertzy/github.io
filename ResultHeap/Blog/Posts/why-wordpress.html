                <p class="text-indent-post">These days, everyone and their mother (sometimes literally) seem to be using Wordpress as their go to web development provider. Wordpress boasts thousands of templates, along with many plugins to help make your life easier.  Even for the professional web developers, Wordpress offers a lot of creativity with it's coding, allowing the programer to have full customization of the site they are creating.  This is all well and good, but the question still remains; why should I use Wordpress? Throughout this article, I will go over some of the best, and worst, features that Wordpress has to offer in addition to some powerful alternatives. </p>

                <h2>What is Wordpress?</h2>
                <p class="text-indent-post">To put things simply, Wordpress is the most popular blogging tool on the web.  It's one of the simplest ways of creating a blog or website. As I said before, Wordpress powers around 33% of all websites, meaning that around 1 in 3 of all websites you encounter are powered by or created using Wordpress.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-post">If you want to get more technical about things, WordPress is an open-source content management system (CMS) licensed under GPLv2.  This means that anyone can use or alter the Wordpress software for free. Being a content management system, Wordpress makes life easier for the non-programmer to use and modify without needing any previous coding experience.</p>
                <h2>Who uses Wordpress and why do they use it?</h2>
                <p class="text-indent-post">This is a fairly straightforward question. Everyone from big corperations to individuals use Wordpress. Do to it's amazing and powerful CMS, Worpress is a perfect platform to make a blog or website very quickly. Wordpress is constantly expanding.  New plugins are constantly being created, making life for the non-programmer easier.  In addition to all of this, some of the most major companies in the world utilize Wordpress.  Here are just a few of those companies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>BBC America</li>
                    <li>Bloomberg Professional</li>
                    <li>Microsoft News</li>
                    <li>TechCrunch</li>
                    <li>The Walt Disney Company</li>
                    <li>Facebook Newsroom</li>
                    <li>Chicago Sun Times</li>
                    <li>Vogue</li>
                    <li>The Rolling Stones</li>
                    <li>Toyota Motors Brasil</li>
                    <li>The Havard Gazette</li>
                    <li>Usain Bolt</li>
                    <li>Angry Birds</li>
                    <li>Katy Perry</li>
                    <li>AMC</li>
                    <li>And Many More!</li>
                </ul>
               <h2>Pros</h2>
                <p class="text-indent-post">The pros to using Wordpress are vast.  A massive range of templates and plugins are available for usage and nearly every web development company (ResultHeap included) uses Wordpress in some fashion.  Not as experinced users find Wordpress to be an amazing fit as it cuts out the process of having to code everything yourself. Making a blog, business, or marketplace website is simplified with the power of Wordpress.</p>
               <h2>Cons</h2>
               <p class="text-indent-post">Every good web service has it's downfalls and Wordpress is no different.  Despite the wide range of templates and plugins, you can often find yourself not having the feature you want.  Wordpress can often limit the less experience user in how they can design their website, often taging on a price for many of the better services.  You might get close to how you want things to look, but I often find that Wordpress limits my creative abilities.  Furthermore, major web development companies can charge an arm and a leg to make you your own customized Wordpress site (Don't worry, ResultHeap does this for you for much lower costs).</p>
               <h2>Alternatives to Wordpress</h2>
               <p class="text-indent-post">There are plenty of powerful web services that can easily compete with the functionality and power of Wordpress.  Here are some of the most popular:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li><p>Wix.com offers the most flexible designs, while at the same time cutting out a lot of the cumbersome and tedius work and coding that is needed to truely make a Wordpress site shine.</p></li>
                   <li><p>Weebly is widely considered one of the simplest and user friendly Wordpress alternatives on the web.  It provides a massive range of layouts while still giving you the ability to integrate features such as galleries, contact forms, video integration, tags, categories, comments and more.</p></li>
                   <li><p>Shopify works well If you're looking for more of an eCommerce solution.  Shopify allows you to create product variants, manage taxes & shipping effectively all while being able to expand your marketplace with a host of addons and plugins that Shopify provides.  Shopify is considered a good alternative to WooCommerce, a Wordpress friendly eCommerce platform, and keeps things simple for the average user. </p></li>
               </ul>
               <p class="text-indent-post">There are plenty of other alternatives to these as well.  Make sure you do your research before choosing a platform.</p>
